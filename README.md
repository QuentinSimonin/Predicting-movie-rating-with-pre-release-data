# Predicting-movie-rating-with-pre-release-data

This GitHub repository was created as part of my master's thesis untitled: Building a model to predict the rating of a movie using pre-release date: Towards a homogenisation of the film industry?

It contains these 4 files:
1. Creation of datasets using TMDB APIs : Python code - Used to collect data from TMDB APIs - All the information on the extraction methods are in comments in this file
1bis. Extracting New York Times reviews using NYT API: R code - Used to collect reviews from the NYT API - All the information on the extraction methods are in comments in this file
2. Cleaning and pre-preprocessing: Python code - Cleaning and pre-processing of the data collected
3. Models and results: Python code - Creation of 4 different models to test our different variables and analysis of our results

# WARNING - You need to run the different files in this order or you will not be able to properly run the models

If you want more information (on the code or on the subject in general), you can contact me at quentin.simonin@edu.escp.eu.

Thanks!

### Update : The NYT movie review API has been shutdown after the writing of my thesis. It's still possible to run the model but without
